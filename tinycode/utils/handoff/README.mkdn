# Handoff structure for `lilos`

This implements a synchronous rendezvous structure, which lets a task pass a
value to another task without extra copies or reserving storage space.

This used to be part of the core `lilos` API, but was extracted during the
process of finalizing the `lilos` 1.0 version. It is currently separate from
`lilos` because its API is not cancel-safe.

Despite not being cancel-safe, it's still quite useful. See the module docs for
more details.
